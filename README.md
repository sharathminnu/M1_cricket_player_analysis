# M1_cricket_player_analysis
This project is used to calculate the stats of a cricket player.If we give scores of a cricket player this project will calculate and display 
stats of player like Average,Bestscore,Total runs,Total wickets etc.

## INTRODUCTION

Cricket is one of our country's most popular sports. Everyone, from newborns to the elderly, is well-versed in cricket. And we'll discover that cricket has been played on every street in India. Cricket is so popular that almost everyone plays it at least once in their lives.
Statistics such as average, best score, best wickets, and so on have been calculated and tracked for professional cricketers. And no one other than the professional players is in charge of calculating and tracking the metrics for the players. Our project assists people in calculating their own statistics.Our system takes their scores as inputs, calculates the statistics, and presents them.
